Worked under the supervision of Dr.Victoria Chester, an in-person internship at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, I’ve been involved in researching and developing various ML and DL models including CAT Boost,SVM with RBF kernels, KNN algorithms, LSTM’s and CNN’s for the binary classification problem of separating Autism vs Control class groups using multi-segment foot data. 
The data is captured using a 12 camera Vicon motion capturing system which track body movement while walking. 
These cameras track reflected markers located on the skin.Kinematic and kinetic data is computed and used to obtain movement deviations.
Biomechanical signals are processed using Matlab and Visual 3D software. 
I trained neural networks on various datasets including Autism peaks and valleys dataset, Autism waveform dataset which includes raw signals and the raw co-ordinates dataset. 
I also worked on classifying people’s age based on their walking speeds and various multi-segment foot parameters in addition to joint kinetics data, EMG data and kinematics data.
